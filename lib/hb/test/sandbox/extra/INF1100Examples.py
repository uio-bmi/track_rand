# Note on document/approach
# - I have tried to start at examples that could be suited for lecture slides
# - I then continue the examples along the same line. At some point these would
#   anyway be more for tasks (ovinger) for the students
# - I think these discretely- and sequence-oriented examples can be a nice
#   supplement to the current more mathematics-/formula-oriented examples..

# EXAMPLES on list/sequence and looping
# (assumes that basic control (if) has been learned)

# Life is definitely digital. The genetic code of all living organisms are
# represented by a long sequence of simple molecules called nucleotides, or
# bases, which makes up the Deoxyribonucleic acid, or simply DNA. There are only
# four such nucleotides, and the entire genetic code of a human can be seen as a
# simple, though 3 billion long, string of the letters A,C,G,T.

# In this first example, we will simply detect a given letter in a sequence,
# using DNA to learn about strings, lists and looping.

# Could be used in chapter 2 to introduce lists and looping, or in chapter 4 to
# get input from command line.
# Note in relation to ch4: The existing examples on
# raw_input in ch4 starts straight off with numbers and formulas, meaning that
# conversion and eval is needed from the start. The example below would read in
# data (supposed to be some arbitrary DNA) as strings, allowing focusing on data
# input at first, and then later on conversion, eval and exec.

# *************************************************
# Your genetic code is (essentially) the same from you are born until you die,
# and the same in your blood and your brain. What makes your cells different are
# which genes are turned on and off. This regulation of genes is orchestrated by
# an immensely complex mechanism, which we have only started to understand. A
# central part of this mechanism consists of molecules called transcription
# factors that float around in the cell and attach to DNA, and in doing so turn
# nearby genes on or off. These molecules bind preferentially to specific DNA
# sequences, and this binding preference pattern can be represented by a matrix
# of frequencies of given symbols at each position of the pattern.

# This example propose several alternative solutions. The basic solutions could
# fit well already into chapter 3, providing training on the use of looping,
# lists and indexing. Other variants make use of dicts, and could thus be used in
# chapter 6, there possibly referring back to the basic exercise in chapter 3, to
# show how dicts can simplify code.

# This example could fit into chapter 5. Example of making dot-plot from two
# strings, printing it out as a table.

# Dot-plots are commonly used to visualize the similarity between two protein or
# nucleic acid sequences. They compare two sequences by organizing one sequence
# on the x-axis, and another on the y-axis, of a plot. When both sequences match
# at the same location on the plot, a dot is drawn at the corresponding position,
# In our example a dot is represented by 1. No presence at given location is
# represented by 0. A dot-plot can be manually read to find common patterns
# between two sequences that has undergone several insertions and deletions, and
# it servers as a conceptual basis algorithms that align two sequences in order
# to find evolutionary origin or shared functional parts. Such alignment of
# biological sequences is a particular variant of finding the edit distance
# between strings, which is a general technique, also used for e.g. spell
# correction in search engines.

# DNA consists of four molecules called nucleotides, or bases, and can be
# represented as a string of the letters A,C,G,T. But this does not mean that all
# four nucleotides need to be similarly frequent. Are some nucleotides more
# frequent than others, say in yeast, as represented by the first chromosome of
# yeast? Also, DNA is really not a single thread, but two threads wound together.
# This wounding is based on a A from one thread binding to a T of the other
# thread, and C binding to G (that is, A will only bind with T, not with C or G).
# Could this fact force groups of the four symbol frequencies to be equal?
# (answer: the A-T and G-C binding does not in principle force certain
# frequencies to be equal, but in practice they usually become so because of
# evolutionary factors related to this pairing).
# The example could be used in connection with chapter 6 to mainly get
# acquainted with dictionaries, but also to read strings, from files.

# *************************************************
# An important usage of DNA is for cells to store information on their arsenal of
# proteins. These proteins are what makes up the possible functional properties
# of a cell. Proteins are made based on the recipe found in genes. Genes are, in
# essence, only regions of the DNA. These are divided into exons, which are the
# coding regions of the gene, and introns, the regions inbetween. In order for a
# protein to be created, the exon regions are copied out of the DNA, joined
# together and then transcribed into mRNA. mRNA is messenger RNA, which is a
# small DNA-like sequence that is sent to the protein-creating machinery in the
# ribosomes, containing the recipe for a protein. One difference between the
# mRNA and the original DNA is that all T-bases (Thymine) are exchanged with
# U-bases (Uridine). In the ribosome, the mRNA is translated into proteins.
# Here, a genetic code is used to translate triplet of bases, or codons, into
# an amino acid. A protein is made up of a series of amino acids. Interestingly,
# the genetic code, which is the same for most forms of life, contains
# redundancy, i.e. that several codons code for the same aminoacids, as the 64
# possible codons are used to code for only 20 amino acids. 

# Here is an example of using the genetic code to create the amino acid sequence
# of the Lactase protein (LPH) using the DNA sequence of the Lactase gene (LCT)
# as template. An important functional property of LPH is as an restriction
# enzyme to cleave the disaccaaride Lactose into two monsaccarides. Lactose is
# most notably found in milk. Organisms lacking the functionality of LPH will
# get digestive problems including elevated osmotic pressure in the intestine
# leading to diarea and referred to as lactose intolerance. Most mammals and
# humans lose their expression of LCT and therefore their ability to digest milk
# when they stop recieving breast milk.

# The observed rate at which mutations occur at a given position in the genome

# mutation rates betwen different nucleotides vary. One is that there are
# different mechansism generating transitions from one base to another. Another
# is that the efficiency of the repair mechanism, which is an extensive process
# in living dividing cells, varies for different nucleotides. The surrounding
# context of the position determines to what degree there is a working selection
# pressure. If the position is in a region that excerts a function there will be a
# selective pressure.

# Here, we only look at the nucleotide transitions, and not the surrounding context.
# The mutations of single nucleotides may be modelled as a Markov chain, that
# is, a random process that undergoes transitions between a set of states,
# according to a discrete distribution. More specifically, each transition from
# a specific nucleotide to another has a particular probability. The
# probabilities of the transitions going from a nucleotide (including the
# probability of no change, i.e. a transition to itself) must sum to 1. The
# markov chain can thus be specified by a set of 4x4=16 probabilities.

# In this exercise, one must create a random markov chain, and then mutate a

# model the transcription and/or translation process, as explained previsouly.
# The __init__ function of Gene gets the DNA sequence of the gene, and the
# relative location of the exons within that gene. The Gene object creates and
# holds Exon objects, accordingly. There are different subclasses of genes:
# NoncodingGene, and ProteinCodingGene. A noncoding gene only makes RNA, but not
# proteins. The abstract method get_product() is overwritten for the different
# Gene subclasses. The method get_product_len() is inherited, and works on the
# results of the get_product(), the implementation of which changes with the
# class. This is thus an example of polymorphism.

# *************************************************
# When the human genome was sequenced, it turned out that a large part of the
# genome did not seem to serve any specific function. Only around 3% of the
# genome were directly coding for proteins, which is the primary purpose of DNA,
# and referred to as the central dogma of molecular biology. The remaining DNA
# were then often referred to as junk DNA. Although a much larger part of the
# genome has since been understood to perform important functions, a relatively
# large part of our DNA still have no known function. Some of this DNA has a
# very simple, repetitive structure, and is even not of human origin. This is
# referred to as repeating elements. Part of this is for instance the remains of
# viruses that integrated into the DNA of our early ancestors without causing
# any apparent damage. However, although these repeating element typically have
# a simple structure and a non-human origin, this does not necessarily mean they
# today do not serve any function. A basic question to ask, is how much these
# repeating elements fall inside genes. The example doesn't really fit into a
# specific chapter, but could be a small project as a summary example, putting
# different teqhniques together. It involves lists, numpy vectors, looping,
# compound looping, object-orientation, algorithmic thinking, and alternative
# paths to same goal. It also turns out to be a bit more tricky than it may
# appear at first sight. This is more thoroughly described (in norwegian) along
# with input data, hints, and suggested solutions here:
# http://invitro.titan.uio.no/wiki/hyperbrowser/doku.php/public:programming_day
#
# This project needs the following files:
# HumanRepeatsChr1.tsv
# HumanGenesChr1.tsv
# HumanRepeatsChr1Starts.memmap
# HumanRepeatsChr1Ends.memmap
# HumanGenesChr1Starts.memmap
# HumanGenesChr1Ends.memmap


# Get data:
# a) Read intervals (repeating elements and genes) from two tabular files and
#     calculate the total overlap of intervals.
# b) Read numpy-vectors

# Represent data:
# a) As 4 separate lists (start/end of track 1/2)
# b) Objects (list of class Segment, possibly as class SegmentCollection)

# Compute:
# assume: no overlap within each track
# a) all pairs (double for loop)
# each t1-seg vs each t2-seg: count overlap. O(k*l) = O(n^2), where n is number
#                             of segments across tracks
# 
# b) at each bp iterate through segments
# each bp: overlapped by any t1-seg (loop through intervals) and overlap by any
#          t2-seg? O(N*n), where N is number of bps
# 
# c) at each bp, check for coverage in vectors each bp: Covered by t1-seg and
# t2-seg (each track as binary vector)? O(N), i.e. could be more efficient (but
# large memory)
# 
# d) state machine each segment event, that is starts/ends (traversed by
# position, order regardless of track): update state, if in state 4 (inside segs
# for both tracks) count bps until next event. O(n)
# 
# e) numpy-based state computation Combine positional events with state info (by
# compound vector element or by bitwise manipulation), sort elements, perform
# aggregation, compute lengths as distance between events, filter out states of
# interest


# *************************************************
# The regulation of which genes are active at a given time and in a given cell, is a very sophisticated mechanisms
# that involves proteins called transcription factors (TFs) that bind to DNA in order to regulate the expression (use) of nearby genes.
# The locations where a given transcription factor binds, will usually show a certain sequence specificity.
# An important problem is then to try to exploit the sequence specificty of binding, and find common patterns in DNA that may correspond the the binding by such a TF.
# In the example below, the strength of a pattern corresponding to a suggested set of substrings, is compared against patterns from random selections of substrings
# The example could serve as a somewhat larger project, and could also be extended beyond the code below.
# A possible further extension could e.g. be to try to determine the best pattern from scratch (i.e. the variable positionsList).
# This can be done by just making multiple guesses and choosing the best one, or by methods such as Expectation Maximization or Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
# The example involves strings, lists, dicts, looping, functions and randomness
