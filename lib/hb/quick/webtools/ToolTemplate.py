        ###
        Note about the "Galaxy dataset info" data structure:
        ###

        "Galaxy dataset info" is a list of strings coding information about a
        Galaxy history element and its associated dataset, typically used to
        provide info on the history element selected by the user as input to a
        ProTo tool.

        Structure:
            ['galaxy', fileFormat, path, name]

        Optionally encoded as a single string, delineated by colon:

            'galaxy:fileFormat:path:name'

        Where:
            'galaxy' used for assertions in the code
            fileFormat (or suffix) contains the file format of the dataset, as
                encoded in the 'format' field of a Galaxy history element.
            path (or file name/fn) is the disk path to the dataset file.
                Typically ends with 'XXX/dataset_YYYY.dat'. XXX and YYYY are
                numbers which are extracted and used as an unique id  of the
                dataset in the form [XXX, YYYY]
            name is the title of the history element

        The different parts can be extracted using the functions
        extractFileSuffixFromDatasetInfo(), extractFnFromDatasetInfo(), and
        extractNameFromDatasetInfo() from the module CommonFunctions.py.
