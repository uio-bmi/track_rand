_The Genomic HyperBrowser is a generic web-based system for finding and testing relations between high-throughput sequencing and/or other genomic datasets, making use of statistical hypothesis testing and other advanced methodology. The system can be tried out at a publicly available [main web instance](https://hyperbrowser.uio.no)._

_The Genomic HyperBrowser is an extension (and thus a fork) of the Galaxy framework. For more information on the Galaxy project, see [the main Galaxy Github page](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy)_

# Tutorials, discussion forum and news
Several public resources is available for the Genomic HyperBrowser project:

- [A GitHub repository](https://github.com/hyperbrowser/genomic-hyperbrowser) containing the latest source code
- [A set of analysis guides (basic mode), examples and screencasts](https://hyperbrowser.uio.no) of the newest version of the Genomic HyperBrowser, termed GSuite HyperBrowser, are available from the main HyperBrowser server.
- [A set of tutorials with screencasts](https://sites.google.com/site/hyperbrowserhelp/discusison-forum) for the basic HyperBrowser functionality (as available in the initial 1.0 release). (Caveat: these are rather old and not updated with recent functinality)
- [A public forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/the-genomic-hyperbrowser) for questions, opinions and feature requests
- [A public announcements web page](https://sites.google.com/site/hyperbrowserhelp/announcements)
- We also have a mailing list reserved for news (same as in the announcements page), as well as administrative messages (e.g. downtime): [Mailing list](https://sympa.uio.no/usit.uio.no/info/hyperbrowser-info) and [archive](https://sympa.uio.no/usit.uio.no/arc/hyperbrowser-info)


# About the project
The Genomic HyperBrowser (http:// hyperbrowser.uio.no) is an open-ended web server for the analysis of genome-scale data in the form of coordinates relative to reference genome assemblies, i.e. as genomic tracks. Through the provision of several highly customizable components for processing and statistical analysis of genomic tracks, the HyperBrowser opens for a range of genomic investigations, related to, e.g., gene regulation, disease association or epigenetic modifications of the genome.

The current version of the HyperBrowser is the result of an interdisciplinary collaboration established in late 2007, with an ambition of developing a streamlined and generic system for exploring relations between genomic features. Several sub-projects have since then been published, most notably:

- The differential disease regulome (available from the [main web instance](https://hyperbrowser.uio.no))
- HiBrowse - statistical analyses of 3D genome structure (available from a [separate installation](https://hyperbrowser.uio.no/3d)
- ClusTrack (available from the [main web instance](https://hyperbrowser.uio.no))

# The GSuite HyperBrowser
The Genomic HyperBrowser  has in the recent year undergone dramatic improvements focused on epigenome-wide analyses, making powerful use of user-specified suites, or collections, of related datasets. This new expansion, called the GSuite HyperBrowser, empowers researcher to ask questions about their genomic datasets in relation to the vast amount of datasets for different cell types/tissues or different epigenomic marks that has been made available from international projects like ENCODE or Roadmap Epigenomics. GSuite HyperBrowser contains user-friendly guides to answer common domain-specific questions and includes tools for defining suites of datasets, bulk downloading and analysis.

# Installation
The installation procedure can be found in the [HB_INSTALL.md](HB_INSTALL.md) file.
