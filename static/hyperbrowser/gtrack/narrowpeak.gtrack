# GTrack subtype for ENCODE narrowPeak
#
# Works directly with tabular files formatted according to the ENCODE narrowPeak
# format [1]. See [2] for more details on GTrack and the concepts of track
# types. The GTrack specification and GTrack subtypes and example files are
# found at [3].
#
# To use:
#
# A. Add the following line to the beginning of your GTrack file (excluding the
# preceding '# ' characters):
#
# ##subtype url: http://gtrack.no/narrowpeak.gtrack
#
#   or
#
# B. Make sure that the name of your narrowPeak file ends with '.narrowpeak' (or
# a capitalized version). In this case, you do not need to make any changes to
# the contents of the file.
