# Mean/Standard Deviation GTrack subtype 
#
# Contains the specification of the mean/standard deviation value type handled
# by the Genomic HyperBrowser [1,2]. This type can be used for summarizing
# population data for each track element.
#
# The Genomic HyperBrowser will accept the value column as pairs of mean and
# standard deviation values for a GTrack file if the header variable "GTrack
# subtype" is specified as "Mean/sd". This may be done explicitly, or via a
# "subtype URL" declaration (as the subtype specification file, i.e. this file,
# includes the "GTrack subtype" header), or both.
#
# See [3] for more details on GTrack and the concepts of track types. The GTrack
# specification and GTrack subtypes and example files are found at [4].
#
# To use, add the following line to the beginning of your GTrack file (excluding
# the preceding '# ' characters):
#
# ##subtype url: gtrack.no/mean_sd.gtrack
